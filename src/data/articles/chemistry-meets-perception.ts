**Can your nose tell the difference between a rose and a rotten egg by molecule shape alone? In the 1960s, one scientist thought so — and the world listened.**

## Meet John Amoore

In **1963**, British chemist **John Amoore** proposed the now-famous **stereochemical theory of olfaction**[1]. His idea? Smell molecules fit into receptors like keys into locks. Different shapes triggered different receptors, and different combinations of receptors created different odor perceptions.

## The Primary Odors

Amoore even suggested a list of **“primary odors,”** much like the primary colors of light (red, green, blue). These included:

- **Camphoraceous** (think sharp, medicinal scent)
- **Musky**
- **Floral**
- **Pepperminty**
- **Ethereal** (like cleaning fluid)
- **Pungent**
- **Putrid**

According to him, every odor we perceive was a mix of these building blocks, detected through molecular fit.

## A Theory With Teeth

Why did this theory catch fire?

1. **It matched how medicines work**. Scientists already knew that drugs rely on shape to unlock specific effects in the body, so it made sense for smell to do the same.

2. **It explained specific anosmias** — cases where people couldn’t smell one specific odor (like musky or cheese-like odors) but could smell everything else. Maybe they were missing a receptor for that shape.

## Not the Whole Picture — But a Key Chapter

While later discoveries would show that the story of smell is more complex — involving hundreds of odorant receptors and combinatorial coding — Amoore’s work set the stage. He gave scientists a **testable hypothesis** and a conceptual framework to work from.

## Why This Still Matters, Even Today

Amoore’s theory fueled a generation of olfactory science. It also laid the foundation for the **1991 discovery** of the **olfactory receptor gene family** — which proved that yes, we do have hundreds of smell-specific receptors, and yes, they respond (at least in part) to shape.

That makes this 1963 paper one of the most influential — even if no longer the full story.

So next time you smell peppermint, remember: it all started with the idea that your nose reads molecular geometry.
